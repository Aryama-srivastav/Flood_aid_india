# Flood_aid_india
## A web-based flood risk assessment and awareness tool
Our theme was *“Align with an SDG”.* We brainstormed several ideas but most sounded generic or repetitive. During that time, flood-related news was everywhere. That’s where the spark came from. We observed how floods strike every year—come, destroy, disappear and reappear every year, every monsoon—and yet, it's barely addressed. We realized: We can’t stop floods, but we can prevent damage and raise awareness. That led to ***“Flood Aid India”***, a project aligned with 4 SDGs. 

Our team split into sub-groups:
**Design Team:** Created a logo, picked a calming blue-purple palette, added wave animations & visual cues.
**Functionality Team:** Discovered an NDMA report on flood-prone areas and built a damage estimator logic based on: Construction type, Year of construction, City’s flood risk. 
**Structure team:** We tested the platform internally with peers and family for real-world usability. For deployment, we needed a safe, free, customizable platform — we chose Google Sites, which allowed our custom CSS/JS while preserving full functionality and design. 
Final testing ensured cross-platform compatibility, and we launched Flood Aid India — functional, responsive, and user-ready.
